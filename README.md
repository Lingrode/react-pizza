### More about technologies

- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) â€”** is necessary for writing more competent JavaScript code. By writing TS code correctly, we automatically document our code + our application will contain fewer bugs due to strong typing.
- **[Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)** â€” with the help of this library, we will be able to create a global data storage for our application, thus, a more convenient way to exchange information between different components of our application.
- **[React Router v7](https://reactrouter.com/start/library/installation)** â€” will allow us to create navigation on our site without reloading the page. You probably noticed that the Instagram site, when moving to different sections, does not reload the entire page, but only a certain part of the site. This is the feature that we will implement in our application using React Router.
- **[Axios](https://axios-http.com/)** â€” will help us interact with the server part. Send data to the server or receive it, if necessary, from the server already in our front-end application.
- **[React Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks)** â€” This is a set of ready-made functions inside the React library for solving various problems, such as storing data, determining the first display of the application, optimizing functions, etc.
- **[SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)** â€” it's the same CSS, but with more powerful features, functions, variables, loops (yes, Karl, loops in CSS) and a bunch of other cool stuff.
- **[CSS-Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)** â€” we will use SCSS together with CSS modules. In fact, we will not have to learn anything new. We will write the same styles, but in separate files (css modules), thereby encapsulating our CSS classes.
- **[Lodash](https://lodash.com/docs)** â€” a set of ready-made JS functions for a huge number of different tasks.
